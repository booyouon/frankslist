## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

Organization and functionality (making the code look good)

### Weaknesses:

CSS/Styling

### Opportunities:

I am looking forward to challenging myself with the "likes" functionality as well as the styling.

### Threats:

Getting too disorganized and inefficient within the CSS
