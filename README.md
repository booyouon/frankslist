# Frankslist

## Project Description

You work, you eat, you sleep - and that's about it... your life is boring. That's why we made Frankslist! Frankslist is the one stop web application for finding your dream hobby. Create an account, search for hobbies based on your unique lifestyle, and save your favorites! If you have a hobby you would like to share with the community, you can create a new page for that hobby!

Frankslist is optimized for web and mobile with full Back-End CRUD functionality. This project utilizes Mongoose, React, Express, and Node.

## MVP Goals

#### Planning

- [x] Have a thoroughly documented Team Expectations Google document
- [ ] Have a thoroughly developed, beautiful README.md file
- [x] Take time for each team member to discuss where they feel strongest and weakest, in terms of coding ability
- [x] Create a Whimsical document to convey the data flow with component hierarchy included.
- [x] Create a detailed Figma wireframe.

#### Client (Front-End)

- [ ] Have a working, interactive React app, built using npx create-react-app client
- [ ] Have at least 6 separate, rendered components in an organized and understandable React file structure.
- [ ] Utilize functional and class React components appropriately.
- [ ] Use only React for DOM Manipulation.
- [ ] Consume data from your API, and render that data in your components.
- [ ] Utilize React Router, for client-side routing.
- [ ] Have user authentication.
- [ ] Have a home screen, listing screen, and detail screen.

#### Server (Back-End)

- [ ] Have working generic controller actions for full-CRUD using Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.
- [ ] Utilize user authentication.

#### Styling

- [ ] Be styled with CSS.
- [ ] Use flexbox (display: flex) or CSS Grid.
- [ ] Implement responsive design on 2 screen sizes (including desktop) using a media query (mobile).

#### Linting

- [ ] Indent properly.
- [ ] Utilize high-quality, semantic variable names.
- [ ] Follow camelCase and kebab-case conventions.
- [ ] Remove unnecessary boilerplate React files and code.
- [ ] Remove all console.log()s and commented out code (functional notes/comments are okay).

#### Deployment

- [ ] Deploy the fully functional front-end via Netlify.
- [ ] Deploy the back-end via Heroku.
- [ ] Deploy the MongoDB database on MongoDB Atlas.

#### Procedural

- [ ] Have frequent commits from every team member dating back to the very beginning of the project. These commits should total to or exceed 50.
- [ ] Use effective and safe branching and merging processes.
